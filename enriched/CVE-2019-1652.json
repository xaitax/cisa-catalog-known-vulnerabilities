The goal is to first discover cases where the input validation layer executes before one or more parsing layers. That is, user input may go through the following logic in an application: <parser1> --> <input validator> --> <parser2>. In such cases, the attacker will need to provide input that will pass through the input validator, but after passing through parser2, will be converted into something that the input validator was supposed to stop."}], "cvss": 9.0, "cvss-time": "2020-10-05T19:34:00", "cvss-vector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C", "cwe": "CWE-78", "id": "CVE-2019-1652", "impact": {"availability": "COMPLETE", "confidentiality": "COMPLETE", "integrity": "COMPLETE"}, "last-modified": "2020-10-05T19:34:00", "references": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152262/Cisco-RV320-Command-Injection.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152305/Cisco-RV320-RV325-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Mar/61", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106728", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Mar/55", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46243/", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46655/"], "refmap": {"bid": ["106728"], "bugtraq": ["20190327 [RT-SA-2019-005] Cisco RV320 Command Injection Retrieval"], "cisco": ["20190123 Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Command Injection Vulnerability"], "exploit-db": ["46243", "46655"], "fulldisc": ["20190327 [RT-SA-2019-005] Cisco RV320 Command Injection Retrieval"], "misc": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152262/Cisco-RV320-Command-Injection.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152305/Cisco-RV320-RV325-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html"]}, "summary": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands.
