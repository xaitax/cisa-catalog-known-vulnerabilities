Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure that only authorized users are able to access these resources. If access control mechanisms are absent or misconfigured, a user may be able to access resources that are intended only for higher level users. An adversary may be able to exploit this to utilize a less trusted account to gain information and perform activities reserved for more trusted accounts. This attack differs from privilege escalation and other privilege stealing attacks in that the adversary never actually escalates their privileges but instead is able to use a lesser degree of privilege to access resources that should be (but are not) reserved for higher privilege accounts. Likewise, the adversary does not exploit trust or subvert systems - all control functionality is working as configured but the configuration does not adequately protect sensitive resources at an appropriate level."}, {"id": "58", "name": "Restful Privilege Elevation", "prerequisites": "The attacker needs to be able to identify HTTP Get URLs.

Strict interpretation of HTTP get methods means that these HTTP Get services should not be used to delete information on the server, but there is no access control mechanism to back up this logic. This means that unless the services are properly ACL'd and the application's service implementation are following these guidelines then an HTTP request can easily execute a delete or update on the server side. The attacker identifies a HTTP Get URL such as http://victimsite/updateOrder, which calls out to a program to update orders on a database or other resource. The URL is not idempotent so the request can be submitted multiple times by the attacker, additionally, the attacker may be able to exploit the URL published as a Get method that actually performs updates (instead of merely retrieving data). This may result in malicious or inadvertent altering of data on the server."}], "cvss": 7.2, "cvss-time": "2022-07-12T17:42:00", "cvss-vector": "AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "cwe": "CWE-269", "id": "CVE-2020-3950", "impact": {"availability": "COMPLETE", "confidentiality": "COMPLETE", "integrity": "COMPLETE"}, "last-modified": "2022-07-12T17:42:00", "references": ["https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0005.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156843/VMware-Fusion-11.5.2-Privilege-Escalation.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157079/VMware-Fusion-USB-Arbitrator-Setuid-Privilege-Escalation.html"], "refmap": {"misc": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156843/VMware-Fusion-11.5.2-Privilege-Escalation.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157079/VMware-Fusion-USB-Arbitrator-Setuid-Privilege-Escalation.html", "https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0005.html"]}, "summary": "VMware Fusion (11.x before 11.5.2), VMware Remote Console for Mac (11.x and prior before 11.0.1) and Horizon Client for Mac (5.x and prior before 5.4.0) contain a privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper use of setuid binaries.
