An attacker can take advantage of the multiple ways of encoding a URL and abuse the interpretation of the URL.

For instance US-ASCII space character would be represented with %20. This is often referred as escaped ending or percent-encoding. Since the server decodes the URL from the requests, it may restrict the access to some URL paths by validating and filtering out the URL requests it received. An attacker will try to craft an URL with a sequence of special characters which once interpreted by the server will be equivalent to a forbidden URL.

An attacker would try to exploit common filtering problems related to the use of the slashes characters to gain access to resources on the target host. Directory-driven systems, such as file systems and databases, typically use the slash character to indicate traversal between directories or other container components. For murky historical reasons, PCs (and, as a result, Microsoft OSs) choose to use a backslash, whereas the UNIX world typically makes use of the forward slash. The schizophrenic result is that many MS-based systems are required to understand both forms of the slash. This gives the attacker many opportunities to discover and abuse a number of common filtering problems. The goal of this pattern is to discover server software that only applies filters to one version, but not the other."}], "cvss": 5.0, "cvss-time": "2019-12-31T20:25:00", "cvss-vector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N", "cwe": "CWE-22", "id": "CVE-2019-7483", "impact": {"availability": "NONE", "confidentiality": "PARTIAL", "integrity": "NONE"}, "last-modified": "2019-12-31T20:25:00", "references": ["https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2019-0018"], "refmap": {"confirm": ["https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2019-0018"]}, "summary": "In SonicWall SMA100, an unauthenticated Directory Traversal vulnerability in the handleWAFRedirect CGI allows the user to test for the presence of a file on the server.", "vulnerable_configuration": [{"id": "cpe:2.3:o:sonicwall:sma_100_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "title": "cpe:2.3:o:sonicwall:sma_100_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}, {"id": "cpe:2.3:h:sonicwall:sma_100:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "title": "cpe:2.3:h:sonicwall:sma_100:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}], "vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2": [], "vulnerable_product": ["cpe:2.3:o:sonicwall:sma_100_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
